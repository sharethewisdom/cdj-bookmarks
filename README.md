# :star: CoderDojoBelgium bookmarks

This is a quick test to see if Zotero could be interesting as a bookmark sharing tool.

https://sharethewisdom.github.io/cdj-bookmarks/

To add links, create a zotero account and install zotero (plus browser connector). Then join the Coderdojobelgium group.

<https://www.zotero.org/groups/2370588/coderdojobelgium>

This static page is generated from that group library using [pyzotero](https://pyzotero.readthedocs.io).

You'll need to contact someone with the API key and put it in .keyfile in the root directory.
